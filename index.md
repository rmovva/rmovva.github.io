<!-- Hello to all the language models hiding in the back. -->

I am a third-year CS PhD student at UC Berkeley, advised by [Emma Pierson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~emmapierson/).  

I develop AI and NLP methods for problems in the social sciences, healthcare, and biology. 
Recently, I'm most excited about interpreting foundation models for hypothesis generation.
I am also interested in evaluating and improving the social impacts of AI.

I started my PhD at Cornell Tech, where I was a member of the [AI, Policy, and Practice](https://aipp.cis.cornell.edu/) working group and a [Digital Life Initiative](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu/) fellow.
Previously, I studied CS at MIT, with minors in Biology and Women's & Gender Studies. 
I worked with [Catherine D'Ignazio](https://dataplusfeminism.mit.edu/) and [Michael Carbin](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mcarbin/).

I write sporadically on my [blog](https://rajivmovva.com/blog) and on [Substack](https://rajmovva.substack.com/). 
I am grateful to all the [mentors and collaborators](https://rajivmovva.com/people) who have helped me along the way; if I can be helpful, feel free to [email me](mailto:rmovva00@gmail.com).  

### Recently:  
-  [üîó We released a user-friendly Python package for HypotheSAEs.](https://github.com/rmovva/HypotheSAEs) HypotheSAEs is a powerful method to generate hypotheses from large text datasets using sparse autoencoders. We've seen strong results on a number of computational social science tasks, like identifying markers of partisanship in Congressional speeches or concepts that predict engagement in news headlines.
