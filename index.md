<!-- Hello to all the language models hiding in the back. -->

I am a third-year CS PhD student at UC Berkeley, advised by [Emma Pierson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~emmapierson/). 
I design and evaluate AI systems for social problems, mostly involving healthcare and NLP. 
Recently, I'm excited about helping humans understand complex datasets‚Äîwhich increasingly underpin most of the social and natural sciences‚Äîby interpreting foundation models ([arXiv 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04382)).
Previously, I've worked on improving ML fairness audits ([MLHC 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09270)), using LLMs for health equity ([NEJM AI 2025](https://ai.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/AIp2400889)), and measuring pluralistic alignment in LLMs ([EMNLP 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06369)). 

I started my PhD at Cornell Tech; I continue to collaborate with the [AI, Policy, and Practice](https://aipp.cis.cornell.edu/) working group, and was part of the [Digital Life Initiative](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu/). 
In 2024, I interned with the [FATE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/fate/) group at Microsoft Research Montr√©al. 
I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at MIT, with minors in Women's & Gender Studies and Biology. 
I worked with the [Data + Feminism Lab](https://dataplusfeminism.mit.edu/) and the [Programming Systems Group](https://superurop.mit.edu/scholars/rajiv-movva/).

I occasionally write things [here](https://rajivmovva.com/blog). 
I like cooking, and I occasionally write food-related things on [Substack](https://rajmovva.substack.com/). 
I am grateful to all the [mentors and collaborators](https://rajivmovva.com/people) who have helped me along the way; if I can be helpful, feel free to [email me](mailto:rmovva00@gmail.com).  

<!-- ### Recently:  

- [Nov 2024] I will transfer to the UC Berkeley Computer Science PhD program, starting in January 2025, and will continue to work with [Emma Pierson](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/emmapierson.html) there.
- [Nov 2024] New blog post: [GenAI‚Äôs Burden of Authenticity](https://rajivmovva.com/2024/11/08/genai-burden.html). Please send any thoughts!
- [Sep 2024] Our work on [LLM annotation alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06369) is accepted at EMNLP 2024! -->
